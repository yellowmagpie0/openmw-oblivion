# M15 native data and rule provenance

Status: **in progress**. Record decoding is not proof of runtime policy or
physical/crime formulas. Original-game behavioral probes and independent rule
expected values remain required before the S2 gate can close.

## Combat-style binary layout

Target: original TES4/Oblivion, header versions 0.8 and 1.0, 20-byte record
headers. Later-game CSTY layouts are not interpreted as Oblivion policy.

The six CSTD sizes below are independently present in the installed, hashed
winning official records and listed as layouts in Wrye Bash. xEdit's current
optional-tail declaration alone does not cover the shortest installed record.

| CSTD bytes | Present tail | Winning count |
| ---: | --- | ---: |
| 84 | Core attack/dodge/block policy and flags only | 1 |
| 92 | Range multipliers | 7 |
| 104 | Melee/ranged switch distances and buff standoff | 1 |
| 112 | Ranged/group standoff | 6 |
| 120 | Rushing chance and distance multiplier | 14 |
| 124 | Do-not-acquire flag | 100 |

CSAD is 84 bytes (21 finite floats); 71 winning styles have it, exactly those
with the Advanced flag. Padding contains nonzero editor-memory bytes in native
files and must be preserved without treating it as gameplay flags. Probabilities
are byte percentages; directional entries are weights and are not required to
sum to 100. Timer intervals are ordered and nonnegative. Distances/range
multipliers are finite and nonnegative. Additive attack bonuses and advanced
modifiers remain signed; decoding does not invent clamping rules.

Legacy omitted fields are represented as absent values. The editor's displayed
creation defaults are **not yet accepted as original-game runtime defaults**.
Likewise, actors without ZNAM are not silently assigned a zeroed style. The
initial inventory contains 2,218 such actors; policy resolution remains open.
All eight core flag bits are named; the trailing 32-bit flag currently has only
its documented low bit. Unknown subrecords and padding remain in the lossless
payload alongside typed fields.

## Rule/probe gate

No damage, block, armor, mastery, projectile, stealth, pickpocket, crime, fine,
jail, or identity formula has passed its independent oracle gate yet. The data
inventory command reports these open gates and returns failure overall even
when every structural content check passes. Future entries must state units,
rounding/clamping order, thresholds, supported version, independent expected
values and exact retained original-game probe evidence. Do not infer gameplay
acceptance from this document or the inventory counts.
