# Full sewer escape — current handoff

## Target and remaining acceptance

Play the original opening continuously from prison through the physical sewer
exit and fresh-process outdoor save/load. Include ordinary loot/equipment,
combat/traversal and shaman victory, escort reunion, Emperor death/Amulet,
birthsign/class choices, Baurus CharacterGen88 and MQ01 exit88. No injected
health, quest, position or completion, skipped required encounters, or spliced
save state qualifies. **Full escape remains incomplete.**

Remaining: join the genuine course through the solo dungeon/shaman, reunion,
Emperor/Amulet, choices and physical exterior, then prove a single-process new-game
escape and fresh outdoor reload. Separate shaman/late saves do not prove this join.

## Current chunk — joined Substructure combat, loot and equipment accepted

Latest genuine course save:
`build/oblivion-compat/sewer-escape/joined-substructure-gear-06/userdata/saves/Bendu_Olo/Quicksave.omwsave`.
Player(957.130,-28.291,122.501), health76. Original chest cuirass/greaves and war
axe equipped; original healing potion consumed normally for56→76 health. No
pending deaths, physical actions or combat engagements. Captures inspected.
[Joined Substructure proof](SEWER-JOINED-SUBSTRUCTURE-START-VERIFICATION.json).

This follows actual key-corpse Take All, Club equipment and original script04e86e
keyed teleport into022ff6 ([key proof](SEWER-JOINED-KEY-LOOT-VERIFICATION.json)),
then Player-killed rat038819 (62→56 health) and all8 first-chest item types.
All3 new entry comparisons are exact. Rat-victory save retains Player action65;
its exact restoration and later chest save prove normal completion with no death
replay. Chest/gear saves have no pending actions. These remain composite proofs.

Failed rat01 waits too close while rat attacks from190 units and Player dies;
corrected02 faces/approaches/attacks normally. Gear01/02/05 select the reordered
shirt after cuirass, replacing armor;06 selects the greaves already under focus.
03 rejects unsupported absolute mouse before gameplay;04 confirms uinput D-pad
EV_KEY does not reach SDL. No engine/input-helper change was required. Failures
remain failed; corrected input has actual semantic inventory checks.

`joined-substructure-corridor-01` fails its final room arrival: continued movement
without fighting eventually enters the encounter and Player dies. No prefix save
is accepted. The apparent blocking rats are original DORatRunner01/02 (0387da/db),
PACK0387de DORatRun01; they run back through the previous door. Ignored raw-master
audit `original-corridor-rat-routing-audit.json` retains record names/PLDT and hash.
`joined-substructure-corridor-fights-01` fails its facing gate while chasing the
runner after it leaves the cell; no victory or checkpoint accepted.

Current UI course `joined-substructure-runners-zombie-01` joins safe approach,
read-only confirmation that both runners left the cell, physical room entry and
ordinary axe combat with original zombie0491fc. Ignored editable recipe:
`joined-substructure-runners-zombie.json`. Poll launcher93690 before another UI
course. This is running, not accepted; current main save remains the gear save.
Then handle any surviving hostile rat0387d9 and follow the physical route toward
Natural Caverns. Preserve the original fleeing behavior; do not chase runners
into another cell or infer that they require Player kills.

## Verification and reusable opening evidence

Camera preference save/load is fixed and accepted: temporary Vanity/Preview retain
the selected view; old explicit saves remain authoritative. Red regression,
all4 camera/recovery cases and2203 normal engine cases pass. Real idle FP→Vanity
save writesFIRS1 and fresh-loads FirstPerson with exact native state at both
boundaries. [Camera proof](SEWER-IDLE-VIEW-SAVE-VERIFICATION.json).

Current camera-fix ASan/UBSan engine integration PASSES all2203 cases, exact
inventory, zero failures/skips, leak checking enabled and runtime built:
`idle-view-sanitizer-integration-02/verification.json`, source d697f176f8 clean.
First01 also has independently verified2203 passing XML cases, but its supervisor
lost its session before final report; it is not the accepted integration gate.
02 repeats only to resolve that missing terminal evidence. Current rendered
sanitizer fresh reload/save also PASSES: FP observed, exact native entry and actual
FIRS1 save, clean exit0, capture inspected. The source idle FP→Vanity F5 prefix
really writesFIRS1 but its raw scenario fails a10-second SDL receipt timeout
because the wrong key left the default active. Raw failure retained; independent
prefix observation and clean fresh continuation are explicit composite evidence.
Correct key `sdl_input_timeout_seconds=90` is verified in fresh receipt provenance.
Rendered leak checking is disabled; engine leak coverage stays separate.
[Current sanitizer proof](SEWER-IDLE-VIEW-SANITIZER-VERIFICATION.json).
Component3262/Python560 retain their original provenance; no fresh pass inferred.

The genuine opening chain remains linked without state splicing:
[new game→19](SEWER-CONTINUOUS-OPENING-VERIFICATION.json),
[original19→30 escort](SEWER-CONTINUOUS-ESCORT-VERIFICATION.json),
[wall-rat victories/passage](SEWER-JOINED-WALL-RATS-VERIFICATION.json),
[normal healing38→62](SEWER-JOINED-HEALING-VERIFICATION.json),
[first-person room rat](SEWER-JOINED-ROOM-RAT-VERIFICATION.json).
Escort raw failure is solely the inherited MQ01wall24 exclusion: independent
original-record/trace audit accepts the authored wall activation separately.
Wall proof accepts genuine failed03 first-kill F5 followed by exact06 continuation;
all raw failures remain failed. No full single-process acceptance is inferred.

## Reusable gameplay evidence

- [Shaman victory/reload](SEWER-SHAMAN-VICTORY-VERIFICATION.json):18 normal axe
  contacts,11 actual shock releases, charge150→7, unarmed retaliation, Player
  killer and death count1. Player3.780029 HP; two fresh-reload healing casts reach
  17.860031. Legacy87→89 defaults and13 independently audited ONAM poses are
  explicitly reviewed; only tiny animated-body velocity projection differences
  remain. Native death below1 HP explains remaining0.840938 on the dead shaman.
  Post-victory input: `build/oblivion-compat/sewer-escape/shaman-victory-reload-heal-01/userdata/saves/Bendu_Olo/Quicksave.omwsave`.
  CharacterGen30, Natural Caverns; no active engagements/actions/projectiles or
  pending death events. This victory is separate from the later outdoor chain.
- [Exterior exit/reload](SEWER-EXTERIOR-EXIT-VERIFICATION.json): original review
  Finished, MQ01 exit88, cleared chargen history, weather/crime reset, native
  regenerating-rat resurrection, physical Tamriel entry and exact fresh reload.
  Native reset preserves position/death history; Player, attached preserve-state
  and owned-paralysis resets remain guarded. General leveled inventory and broad
  active-actor visual resurrection are unverified. Outdoor input:
  `build/oblivion-compat/sewer-escape/sewers03-outdoor-reload-02/userdata/saves/Bendu_Olo/Quicksave.omwsave`.
  Health85.971672, Warrior class/birthsign, one Amulet, no key. Three failed
  encounter probes contributed genuine pre-failure F5 prefixes only; all failed
  statuses and eight exact composite boundaries remain explicit in the artifact.

## Known limits and operation

General NPC spell fallback and Player Flare remain unsupported; the shaman proof
covers staff/unarmed combat. Upright goblin corpses, blank birthsign descriptions
and take-all-only loot remain gaps. Other birthsign choices lack this runtime
coverage. No full M15/S7/E1 or general magic/dialogue acceptance is implied.

Run UI courses singly. Use dpad_y hat axes: virtual-pad EV_KEY D-pad buttons do
not reach SDL here. Linked choices begin unselected; Down then A chooses first.
F5 needs a closed conversation. Keep failed/death attempts and original evidence
provenance. Historical detail: [SEWER-ESCAPE-HISTORY.md](SEWER-ESCAPE-HISTORY.md)
and the linked verification artifacts.
