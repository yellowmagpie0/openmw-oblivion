# M15S4 delivery audit

Status: **incomplete**, inspected at `4996a2eb1a3a666751358f7435a459907e6e6345`
on 2026-10-15. This is a working requirement map, not acceptance. The controlling
scope is [S4 in the implementation plan](M15-COMBAT-STEALTH-CRIME-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md#s4---deliver-a-normal-input-melee-slice),
including its tests and gate. Historical pure-rule, isolated body and service
checkpoints in the milestone ledger do not establish complete live gameplay.

## Required implementation

| S4 item | Current source evidence | Remaining delivery work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Input through contact for Player, NPC and creature | `CharacterController::updateOblivionWeaponState`, `dispatchOblivionMeleeContact`, `advanceOblivionMeleePlayback`; `Actors::update` handles paused input. Ordinary Player/NPC contact reaches `commitOblivionOrdinaryMeleeContact`. | Creature dispatch explicitly returns before contact. Trace and verify every actor route through production input, animation and class/service ownership. |
| 2. Blade/blunt/unarmed/creature, normal/directional power, geometry | `oblivionmelee.cpp` acquires collision/LOS contacts and resolves ordinary weapon/unarmed damage. `isOrdinaryMeleeContactPending` admits only Left/Right kinds. | Power selection can create animation/action ownership, but the ordinary contact predicate rejects power kinds. Directional/mastery selection is explicitly unfinished in the controller. Creature attacker and victim domains are rejected by ordinary adapters. Implement the native routes and verify geometry without a TES3 chance roll. |
| 3. Block, mitigation, wear, fatigue and reactions | `beginBlocking`/`endBlocking` own posture; ordinary contacts prepare values, conditions, RNG and timed knockback. | `resolveOblivionOrdinaryWeaponContact` rejects a facing blocking victim. Zero-after-wear weapon/armor cases are rejected before contact. Complete equipped block, breakage and reaction publication, including actual renderer/physics recovery, once per window. |
| 4. Safe interruptions | Controller cancellation clears strike/input/posture before animation disable. Actors cancel Player and owned stationary intents on pause and control locks. | Verify all named transitions: weapon change/breakage, unequip, menu/control lock, stagger/knockdown, death, load, mount; release/held-input behavior and restarted ownership need live coverage. Existing guards alone are not proof of the entire matrix. |
| 5. Actual animation, HUD and sound | Native KF timing, native swish and unarmored NPC hit sound requests are wired in the controller. | Contact sound selection excludes armored/blocking victims and creature families. Complete native reaction animation and related sound/HUD feedback; verify rendered output and captured audio. |
| 6. Command/query semantics | `OblivionCombatService` and World/script adapters share native values, process action and engagement. S3 accepts authority/persistence infrastructure. | Audit every melee-related command/query against the completed contact, mastery and reaction paths. S3 authority acceptance does not prove those later semantics. |
| 7. Minimal production stationary opponent | `updateOblivionStationaryMeleeAi` sets attack intent after production reach/LOS checks; authored deterministic CSTY fixture and prior runtime matrices exist. | Revalidate alongside completed Player blocking and recovery. It must continue through controller/contact, without injected damage or outcomes. Full S7 movement/style policy remains outside this item. |
| 8. Mastery, dropped items and narrow effects | S2 pure rules and prepared inventory/resource primitives exist. | Wire every melee/block/armor mastery branch to live contacts, dropped-item identities and required timed effects. Enchanted weapon contact currently returns nullopt; resolve the narrowly required combat hook rather than declaring all effects deferred to M16. |

Other deliberate ordinary-contact restrictions include sneaking, nonzero normal
weapon resistance, negative incoming damage, and some zero-fatigue branches.
They need their reviewed native branches before broader contact acceptance.
Removing a rejection without its complete consequences does not deliver a branch.

## Required verification

The section 8 minimum rows relevant to S4 are Melee/contact, Block/armor,
Mastery and Reactions. Cover discrete branches at L1 and appropriate pairwise /
high-risk crosses at L2/L3. Required live assertions include exact pre/post Health,
Fatigue, armor and weapon condition, contact identity and no replay.

The explicit S4 course still needs a named nonlethal target attacked with normal
input, blocking its production-policy attack, misses outside reach and behind a
wall, and recovery after stagger. Repeat first/third person, keyboard/mouse and
gamepad, and FPS cases. Save/quit/fresh-process load during windup, blocking and
recovery must match uninterrupted continuation. These are distinct from idle
restart or direct rule/service tests. The final gate is input -> animation
contact -> one native delta -> visible/audible reaction. Also retain the plan's
sanitized synthetic melee course requirement.

## Current regression evidence

`build/oblivion-compat/m15/S4/current-melee-engine-01/verification.json` rebuilds
`openmw`, `openmw-tests` and `esmtool`, then passes all **49 selected engine cases**
with exact inventory/XML agreement, no failures and no skips. Filter:
`*Melee*:*Blocking*:*Weapon*:*Unarmed*:*PhysicalContact*`.
This is not the full engine inventory, component coverage, sanitizer coverage or
the complete S4 matrix. Tested source fingerprint:
`61f0c6034959308e06384f3bb02a355f7d13c30f1ee99a2e53a5d9858934f3e6`.

Prioritize complete live contact branches and their reaction integration over
additional isolated arithmetic coverage. The rejection sites above provide
concrete next integration points; preserve S2 native-rule provenance.

The same 49 selected cases pass under ASan/UBSan in
`S4/current-melee-engine-sanitized-01`, with exact inventory agreement and zero
failures/skips. ASan leak checking is disabled; UBSan halts on errors. Source
fingerprint: `7e2ba3a41a35cba1c8045c120644501911f0f0e71438769dddf4d7b425b11cb3`.
The intervening source change is this audit document; gameplay code is unchanged.

`S4/current-firstperson-restart-02/verification.json` records a current-build
normal-input unarmed miss and idle fresh-process restart. PIDs 427968 and 428183
are distinct and terminal. The schema-29 source migrates to schema46. Exactly
one action advances the counter2 -> 3, one miss spends Fatigue140 -> 133, and
no pending action or strike survives; Fatigue regenerates before saving.
Both outputs preserve all nine source native actor-value arrays, all four
Player inventory items (absent ownership defaults normalized), and combat RNG.
The second input hash matches the first output. Binary SHA256:
`86b283aa1bd04507cd1d6b8ccc23e45b4506ca597c07da970bd0c3262435fcc2`.
The report also records the loaded MyGUI library and source/output save hashes.

Actual captured PCM has exactly one matching stock `wpn_swishhand_02.wav`
cluster before restart (correlation0.9999204689) and none afterward, using the
unchanged prior acceptance threshold and hash-identified stock assets. Both
ready and restarted screenshots were directly reviewed: the dungeon and drawn
first-person unarmed hands render. The original source stays unchanged.
The preserved `current-firstperson-restart-01` attempt failed before engine
launch because `miss_fixture` was missing from the invocation; corrected02
supplies the declared fixture path. The failed attempt proves no gameplay.

This course covers a miss and **idle** restart only. It does not establish
nonlethal target damage, blocking an opponent, reactions, other weapons/views/
controls, power/mastery, or windup/block/recovery restart equivalence. All those
requirements above remain open. No gameplay implementation changed in this
audit checkpoint, and S4 is not delivered.
